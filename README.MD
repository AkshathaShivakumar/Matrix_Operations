📌 Matrix Operations (Addition & Transpose)
📝 Project Description

This is a simple Java project that performs basic matrix operations.
It allows users to:

Take input for two matrices

Perform Matrix Addition (if dimensions match)

Perform Matrix Transpose (row → column conversion)

Display results in clean matrix format

This project is part of my Java learning journey (pre-OOP stage), focusing on arrays, loops, and methods.
